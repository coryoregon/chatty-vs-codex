# ðŸ§  Chatty vs Codex

**Sandbox for Codex experiments and prompt scripts**

This repo is where I tinker, test, and occasionally argue with my AI collaborator â€” Chatty.  Expect half-finished ideas, clever breakthroughs, and the occasional existential bug.

## ðŸš€ What Lives Here

- Prompt experiments and iterations  
- Codex and agent script tests  
- Workflow automation notes  
- Random Chatty exchanges that got too technical for the chat window

## ðŸ§© Planned Structure
/scripts â†’ code experiments and tools
/prompts â†’ reusable or interesting prompt chains
/notes â†’ docs, results, and reflections

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Every repo starts chaotic â€” the point is to make the chaos useful.
